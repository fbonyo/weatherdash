🌤️ Week 3 – Progress Report (WeatherDash)
🔵 1. What I Built This Week

This week focused on completing all UI documentation and preparing the system for development.

✔ Completed Work

🟠 2. Challenges I Faced
❗ Main Issues

Structuring the UI before writing any code

Managing Git pull/push conflicts

Creating proper design documentation without full Figma screens

💡 How I Solved Them

Broke down each screen into sections + screenshot placeholders

Followed proper Git workflow:

git pull → git add → commit → push

Used clear markdown sections to represent UI without needing Figma
